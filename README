README file for the Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES)

= Installation =

Glues is set up for building on many platforms.  To facilitate cross-platform compatibility, the
GNU autotools are used.

== Quick install ==

From the .tgz distribution archive, run the file ./configure, then make

> ./configure && make

You should (but you can) not install GLUES in your system, rather use the provided example scripts run*.sh do execute glues.

== More detailed installation ==

 1. If you downloaded the developer's version via mercurial CVS, you don't have a ./configure script.  You can
    create this with the ./bootstrap shell script. 

> ./bootstrap

 2. Run ./configure, you can find generic help on configure options in the file INSTALL.

> ./configure

 3. If there are WARNING messages at the end of ./configure, please see below, otherwise, continue to building

 4. Run make (preferably gnu make) to build the glues system,  you should end up with an executable glues in 
    the directory src.


== Warnings and errors during installation ==

 1. WARNING: no configuration information is in src/sisi  
    There is no ./configure in the subdirectory sisi; this is only needed if you don't have the sisi library
    installed elsewhere on your system, i.e., if you need a new build of sisi

    Go to src/sisi and issue ./bootstrap, if you get errors, run autoreconf -fvi, then ./bootstrap again

> (cd src/sisi; ./bootstrap || autoreconf -fvi && ./boostrap)
> (cd src/sisi; ./configure && gmake )

 2. Doxygen not found but required to build documentation
    There is no doxygen on this system, and the documentation will not be build.  This doesn't prevent you from
    running GLUES.  If you need the API documentation, install doxygen, and run configure again.
