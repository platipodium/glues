Abstract: 
Global population density, subsistence style, and technological progress for the period
9500 BC to 2000 BC were hindcasted with the Global Land Use and technological Evolution 
Simulator (GLUES) for 685 land regions of the world.  The intensification of subsistence
is visible in the transition from hunting-gathering to agropastoral life style in many 
world regions.  This transition is based on an increase of domesticated plant and animal
resources and technological progress, and can sustain much higher population densities
than the foraging life style.
Initial values for each prognostic variable are identical at simulation start (9500 BC),
but the background vegetation varies.  Vegetation productivity in terms of net primary 
production (NPP) was derived from Climber-2 climate anomalies on the IIASA database for 
mean monthly precipitation and temperature and subsequent application of the
Miami model.
Data are presented as 50-year averages with time indicating the central year of each 50-
year period (i.e. -2425 denotes the period 2450 BC - 2401 BC), and geographically
on a half degree grid with latitude and longitude values denoting the central value
within each grid cell.
