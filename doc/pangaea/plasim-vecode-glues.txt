Abstract: 

Topographic
data of this geological map were obtained through stereoscopic aerial
photo interpretation. The photogrammetric photo flights were undertaken
in 1986 by the Institut für Angewandte Geodäsie, Frankfurt. Horizontal
ground control points required for aerial photo interpretation were
determined by means of Doppler satellite observation during the 2nd
German Neuschwabenland Expedition 1985/86. Vertical ground control
points were taken from unpublished map drafts at 1:100 000 scale by
Norsk Polarinstitutt, Oslo. The elevation above mean sea level was
transferred to Heimefrontfjella barometrically. For this reason
assertions concerning the absolute elevation (referred to sea level) are
uncertain. Contours and spot heights presented on the map were obtained
from the photogrammetric evaluation of the photography taken in 1986;
relative elevation data (hight differences) are accurate to
approximately ±10 m.
