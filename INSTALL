Installation instructions for the GLUES simulator
==================================================

Run the usual 

./configure && make

to generate the executable program (located locally in the ./bin 
directory).  For options to the configuration utility, run 

./configure --help

Run 

make install

ONLY if you want the executable in your installation 
directory (default /usr/bin).  We do not recommend this at the
time being.
