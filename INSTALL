Installation instructions for the GLUES simulator
==================================================

Run the usual 

./configure && make

to generate the executable program (located locally in the ./bin 
directory).  For options to the configuration utility, run 

./configure --help

It is not recommended as of now to run

make install

This will install the binaries glues region and random_variation into
$PREFIX/bin, where the default prefix is $HOME/opt

Instead, run the local script run.sh to start the example simulation.
