Installation instructions for the GLUES simulator
==================================================

Run the usual 

./configure && make

to generate the executable program (located locally in the ./bin 
directory).  For options to the configuration utility, run 

./configure --help

It is not recommended as of now to run

make install

This will install the binaries glues region and random_variation into
$PREFIX/bin, where the default prefix is $HOME/opt

Instead, run the local script run.sh to start the example simulation.


Problems and how to get around them
=========================================

Problems are documented in the bug database on sourceforge.net.  If you encounter a problem in the
installation or compilation of GLUES, please consult the tracker for existing bugs and how to get 
around them.  If the issue has not been documented, please create a new item with a description of the
error message and how to reproduce it.

1) ./configure no permission to execute 
   Just make configure executable, i.e. chmod +x ./configure

2) sisi directory cannot be found
  Download the sisi package from the GLUES sourceforge site and compile it separately, then, set
  the path to sisi as a configure option
  > ./configure --with-sisi=/path/to/your/sisi/location
